# UP2 Board Getting Started Guide

This guide will walk you through powering on your board and getting a first project going (to blink an LED). Let’s get going!

### Gather your materials
You’ll need the following:
*	UP2 board
*	Power cord
*	Micro USB cable
*	Grove Pi+ Board
* Grove LED sensor and Grove 4-pin wire
*	Ethernet cable with network connection

## Setup Process
There are three steps to beginning development with your Up2 boards-kits

1. [Setup the Hardware](up2-setup-hardware.md)
2. [Install the Arduino Create Agent on Your Development Computer](setup-arduino-create-agent.md)
3. [Register Your Up2 Board as a Device on Arduino Create](up2-register-device.md)
4. [Deploy a Simple Program to verify that is works](up2-blink-led.md)
